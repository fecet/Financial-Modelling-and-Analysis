To replicate such option, we construct our portfolio by buying \\(\\Delta_0\\) stock and investing remaining in risk-free asset at return \\(r\\): \\[ (V_0-\\Delta_0S_0)(1+r)+\\Delta_0S_1=(S_1-K)^{+} \\] solve: \\[ V_0=\\frac{p V_1(H)+qV_1(T)}{1+r},\\Delta_0= \\frac{V_1(H)-V_1(T)}{S_1(H)-S_1(T)} \\] where \\(p=\\frac{1+r-d}{u-d},q=1-p\\). \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) can be then seen as probability assigned to \\(\\mathop{{}\\mathbb{P}}\\left\\{ H \\right\\}\\) and \\(\\mathop{{}\\mathbb{P}}\\left\\{ T \\right\\}\\). Then \\(V_0\\) is just the discounted of expected value of such option, such measure \\(\\mathop{{}\\mathbb{P}}\\) is called risk-neutral. 2.2 State price Suppose \\(\\bm{S_0}\\in \\mathbb{R}^{N}\\) is price of \\(N\\) stocks at time \\(0\\), and \\(\\bm{D}\\in \\mathbb{R}^{N\\times n}\\) is their price at time \\(t\\) for \\(n\\) states. For any portfolio \\(\\bm{\\theta}\\in \\mathbb{R}^{N}\\), it cost \\(\\bm{S_0&#39;\\theta}\\) and its value is \\(\\bm{D&#39;\\theta}\\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}\\) for all \\(n\\) states. An arbitrage is then defined as a portfolio \\(\\theta, s.t.\\) \\(\\bm{S&#39;\\theta}\\) have different sign with \\(\\bm{D&#39;\\theta}\\). Definition 2.1 (State price) A state price vector is \\(\\psi \\in \\mathbb{R}_{++}^{n}\\) \\(s.t.\\) \\(\\bm{S_0}=\\bm{D\\psi}\\). To justify the name of state price, suppose we want to “bet” the state of market, \\(i.e.\\), we would like earning \\(\\bm{1}_{state=i}\\), then our portfolio supposed to be \\(\\bm{D&#39;\\theta}=\\bm{e_i}\\), and it cost \\[ \\bm{S_0&#39;\\theta}=\\bm{\\psi&#39;D&#39;\\theta=\\psi&#39;e_i=}\\psi_i \\] so the coordinate of \\(\\bm{\\psi}\\) is the price of “betting” a state. Theorem 2.1 () There is no arbitrage iff there is a state price vector. Theorem 2.2 (Separating Hyperplane Theorem) Suppose \\(M\\) and \\(K\\) are closed convex cones in \\(\\mathbb{R}^{d}\\) that \\(M \\cap K=\\left\\{ \\bm{0} \\right\\}\\), if \\(K\\) isn’t a liner space, then there is a nonzero linear \\(f\\) separated them, \\(i.e.\\), \\(f(x)&lt;f(y)\\) for any \\(x\\in M\\) and \\(y \\in K- \\left\\{ \\bm{0} \\right\\}\\). Theorem 2.3 (Riesz Representation Theorem) Any continuous linear function \\(f\\) on Hilbert space \\(\\mathcal{H}\\) can be written as \\(f(x)=\\left\\langle x,v \\right\\rangle\\) for some \\(v \\in \\mathcal{H}\\). Proof. Let \\(M=\\left\\{ (-\\bm{S_0&#39;\\theta},\\bm{D&#39;\\theta}):\\theta \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N} \\right\\}\\) and \\(K=\\mathbb{R}_{+}\\times \\mathbb{R}_{+}^{n}\\). Then there is no arbitrage iff \\(K\\cap M=\\left\\{ \\bm{0} \\right\\}\\). \\(\\implies\\), let \\(f\\) be the functional in theorem 2.2, note \\(M\\) is a linear space, \\(f\\) should be vanish on \\(M\\), \\(i.e.\\), \\(f(x)=0,\\forall x \\in M\\), otherwise, fix \\(f(y)&gt;0\\) for \\(y\\in K-\\left\\{ 0 \\right\\}\\), we can find \\(\\lambda \\in \\mathbb{R}\\) \\(s.t.\\) \\(\\lambda f(x)=f(\\lambda x)&gt;f(y)\\). Then by theorem 2.3, we have \\(f(x)=x&#39;v\\) for some \\(v\\), write \\(v=(\\alpha,\\phi)\\) where \\(\\alpha\\in \\mathbb{R}\\) and \\(\\phi \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}\\). Since \\(f(x)&gt;0\\) for nonzero \\(x \\in K\\), \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\phi\\) should strictly positive, then \\[ - \\alpha \\bm{S_0&#39;\\theta}+\\bm{\\phi&#39;D&#39;\\theta}=0 \\] which implies \\(-\\alpha \\bm{S_0}+\\bm{D\\phi}=\\bm{0}\\) and thus \\(\\frac{\\phi}{\\alpha}\\) is a state price vector as required. \\(\\impliedby\\), Suppose \\((-\\bm{S_0&#39;\\theta},\\bm{D&#39;\\theta}) \\in K\\), then, \\(\\bm{\\psi&#39;D&#39;\\theta}\\le 0\\) and \\(\\bm{D&#39;\\theta}\\), which contrast to \\(\\psi \\gg 0\\). Exercise 2.1 () 1 Solution. Given above. Exercise 2.2 () 2 Solution. Setup: \\[ \\bm{S_0}=(1,S_0)&#39;, \\bm{D}=\\begin{bmatrix} 1+r &amp; 1+r \\\\ uS_0 &amp; dS_0 \\\\ \\end{bmatrix} \\] then the state price should be \\[ \\bm{\\psi}=\\bm{D^{-1}S_0}=[(-u+1+r)S_0,(d-1-r)S_0]&#39;\\gg 0 \\] then claim follows. Exercise 2.3 () 3 Solution. No. Let \\(\\psi=(\\frac{1}{3},\\frac{1}{3})\\), it’s a state price vector. Exercise 2.4 () 4 Solution. Note column space of \\(D\\) is just \\(\\left\\{ \\lambda\\cdot(1,2,3)&#39;: \\lambda \\in \\mathbb{R} \\right\\}\\), which excluded \\(\\overline{q}\\), therefore there is no state price vector and thus arbitrage exists. Suppose \\(\\bm{p}\\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}\\) is a probability vector represent each state, as there is only \\(n\\) states, we can use it to represent probability measure. Then \\[ \\mathop{{}\\mathbb{E}}_{}S_T=\\bm{Dp} \\] take \\(\\bm{p=\\frac{\\psi}{e&#39;\\psi}}\\). Then \\[ \\mathop{{}\\mathbb{E}}_{}S_T=\\bm{\\frac{D\\psi}{e&#39;\\psi}}=\\bm{\\frac{S_0}{e&#39;\\psi}} \\] thus \\(\\bm{e&#39;\\psi}\\) is the discount on riskless borrowing. If probability vector \\(\\bm{p}\\) also let \\(\\mathop{{}\\mathbb{E}}_{}S_{T}\\) have the same value, we said it’s a risk-neutral probability measure. A claim \\(C\\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}\\) and it’s said to be attainable or can be hedged if there is a portfolio \\(\\theta\\) that \\(\\bm{D&#39;\\theta}=C\\). Theorem 2.4 () With absence of arbitrage, the price of an attainable claim \\(C\\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}\\) is \\(\\bm{e&#39;\\psi}\\mathop{{}\\mathbb{E}}_{}C\\) if \\(\\bm{S_0}=\\bm{e&#39;\\psi}\\mathop{{}\\mathbb{E}}_{}S_T\\) for some probability measure \\(\\bm{\\psi}\\). Proof. Suppose \\(\\bm{D&#39;\\theta=C}\\), then its price should be \\(\\bm{\\theta&#39;S_0}\\) \\[ \\mathop{{}\\mathbb{E}}_{}C=\\mathop{{}\\mathbb{E}}_{}\\bm{D&#39;\\theta}=\\frac{\\bm{\\theta&#39;D\\psi}}{\\bm{e&#39;\\psi}}=\\bm{\\theta&#39; S_0} \\] A market is said to be complete if every claim \\(C\\) is attainable. Theorem 2.5 () The market in our setting is complete iff \\(N\\ge n\\) and \\(\\bm{D}\\) have full column rank. Proof. Completeness is precisely equivalent row space \\(\\mathcal{C}(\\bm{D&#39;})=\\mathbb{R}^{n}\\) and then claim follows. In complete market, risk-neutral measure is unique. 2.3 Discrete Martingale Under risk-neutral measure, for each time \\(k\\), we have \\[ \\psi_{0}\\mathop{{}\\mathbb{E}}_{k}{S}_{k+1}=S_{k} \\] thus if we define the discounted stock price as \\(\\widetilde{S}_{k}=\\psi_0^{k} S_{k}\\)(where each \\(\\psi_0\\) can be vary by time so it should be \\(\\prod_{i=1} ^{k} \\psi_{0,k}\\) but we abuse notation here), then \\(\\widetilde{S}\\) became a martingale. That implies the discounted claim \\(\\widetilde{V}\\) is also a martingale. Now let \\((\\varphi_n,\\psi_n)\\) be the amount of stock and bound at time \\(n\\), the portfolio we holding value: \\[ V_n=\\varphi_{n}S_n+\\psi_{n}B_n \\] since the portfolio is self-financing, the should equal to the value at the start of \\(n+1\\)(when the price is remain the same): \\[ V_n=\\varphi_{n+1}S_n+\\psi_{n+1}B_n \\] Put them together and take discount, we have \\[ \\widetilde{V}_n=\\varphi_{n+1}\\widetilde{S}_{n}+\\psi_{n+1}=\\varphi_{n}\\widetilde{S}_{n}+\\psi_{n} \\] we have \\[ \\widetilde{V}_{n+1}-\\widetilde{V}_n=\\varphi_{n+1}(\\widetilde{S}_{n+1}-\\widetilde{S}_n) \\] By induction we have \\[ \\widetilde{V}_n=V_0+\\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\\varphi_{i+1}(\\widetilde{S}_{i+1}-\\widetilde{S}_{i}) \\] that is a martingale by invoking following lemma: Lemma 2.1 () Suppose process \\(X=\\left\\{ X_{t} \\right\\}_{t\\in \\mathbb{N}}\\) is adapted to \\(\\mathbb{F}=\\left\\{ \\mathcal{F}_t \\right\\}_{t \\in \\mathbb{N}}\\) and \\(\\left\\{ \\varphi_i \\right\\}_{i \\in \\mathbb{N^{+}}}\\) is \\(\\mathbb{F}\\)-predictable. Then \\[ \\left\\{ Z_n\\triangleq Z_0+\\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\\varphi_{i+1}(X_{i+1}-X_i) \\right\\}_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}} \\] is a martingale if so is \\(X\\). Now we turn to stocks market consist \\(N\\) stocks, construct sample space as \\(\\Omega\\) be all possible path \\((\\mathbb{R}^{N})^{T}\\). The absence of arbitrage give a risk-neutral measure for which \\[ S_{t-1}=\\psi_{0}\\mathop{{}\\mathbb{E}}_{S_{t-1}}S_{t} \\] and as before, take discount \\(\\widetilde{S}_{t}=\\psi_{0}^{t}S_{t}\\) we have a martingale. And we claim that absence of martingale is equivalent to existence of risk-neutral measure.
